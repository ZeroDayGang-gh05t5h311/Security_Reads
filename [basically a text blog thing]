Random Security ramble writing.....[basically a text blog thing]
[09/01/2026]
"Hello Friend", yea that was kind of lame: but not as lame as all the mistakes in the only hacker show that(and I'm paraphrasing here): "make me not want to throw anything at the T.V by the end of the first series". Anyway: cheap ploy to get you're attention aside: What is computer security? Well, in it's most basic sense it means making sure that devices/software are only accessed by authorized users. So today I have not really done anything much as IRL I had a few things to do. I am so sorry for the mistakes I've made in the past I'm just trying my best to learn from them an do much better in the future, not being so lazy: abstaining from alcohol and the like. It's a hangover from the person I was: to the man I'm working to become: it will take some time but have a feeling it will be worth it.

So this week I have refactored some of the code base for a few things:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Security_Demo_Web_App

All but the cpp file(don't have the required library's for SQL on this box though that was my first choice for back-end)

Fixed and improved this in various ways:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.py

Made an untested powershell version: 

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.ps1

A lovely sea-plus-plus version:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.cpp

And updated this a bit:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/SysNyAdminEnny.cpp

And updated this quite a bit:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/Sila.cpp


Plus studied a bit for serious upcoming projects... hopefully, much more to come.

Just a little mid-week report, updated this:
https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/Addison.py
It's modular now and yes I will be working hard on CVES and CVES_ASM as stand-alone script and here in Addison.
Also updated this:
https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.sh

Pretty neat for shell script but the python or cpp version may be more people's fancy..

BONUS:

would you like to know a cheap but kinda slick way to break wpa2 and possibly wpa3 networks? Well read on...
firstly you will need to be somewhat aware of and have the ability to run:
https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng
and:
https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=aireplay-ng
and also: 
https://github.com/t6x/reaver-wps-fork-t6x
https://code.google.com/archive/p/reaver-wps <(the original version)

The process of the attack is fairly simple: 

Run airodump-ng to get a list of target AP's!

Find and AP you want to attack(don't worry if wps is not enabled)

Get the mac address of the router and start de-authing it...(any tool's that have this functionality can be use 
for it this is just what I recommend). Then with the right timing run the reaver attack against the target AP...NOTE:
Timing is everything to this attack and some vendor's have patched it(or at least the ability to de-auth them(thus 
stopping part of the attack.))What it should do if the timing is correct is give you either the WPA2 password in plaintext...
or the wps password(even if it's not enabled), and then you can use either to connect to the target AP.

Also should note that this is not a new attack: I found this back in 2015 when I was a pure script kiddie...
Just wanted to bring attention to it as some people may be vulnerable. Also I don't know if it works against WPA3.
I used this back in 2015-2017 against all major provider's in the U.K and it worked: EE, BT, Virgin, NetGear... ALL OF THEM! Now there is a little caveat to this attack in the sense that being a script kiddie back then I did not keep documentation nor notes or anything... I just broke into sh*t. So sorry I can't be of more help enumerating devices that may be vulnerable to this attack. Don't even know what to call it as it's not really an "0day" or anything.  But it is certainly a very nasty attack.  Can it be pulled off today?  I have no idea: would say the biggest caveat to that would be that routers are allot smarter in the way the respond to de-auth packets than they where 8-10 years ago when this was first discovered: but please In a legal and ethical way: feel free to do the research and find out what's vulnerable.  Again the timing is very key so try to have a few terminal windows open so that when the router goes down you can run that REAVER attack against it in a promptly fashion. Now I suspect(thanks to watching the movie "algorithm" after i found it btw). That the way this works is that is taking advantage of the fact that the firewall loads last. Again sorry for the lack of info about firmware versions and things but there may be ways to pull this off with more modern firmware's with some persistence... enjoy.

Hello again reader:

Last week was very light in terms of output: won't lie that was by design a little, to explain:
As Mentioned previously: I'm moving on to other projects more(mostly bug bounty's but maybe open to other things):

So I've been taking steps to slowly make that adjustment. Don't want to just abandon the code on here though most of the programming I do from the end of this first quarter will not be public: Still i could not stand to just leave this in such disarray so have been slowly fixing things... today: 

 https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/CVES.cpp

Works great now... as does:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/CVES(POC).py

and:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/BanScan.cpp

Had a bit of fun playing with all 3 a bit today and may have more to do but sadly for most of the code hosted: it 
will basically be left by the wayside as I move forward.
Oh and just for the fun of it I thought I would doxx myself and show you a cheeky logic bug that led to a 
full account takeover. so check that out on my X account... will be linked to a video from my old profile... 
that was fun to look over aha. Anyway: look forward to the future: enjoy!

So it's been a little while: lot's of fun/interesting changes in my personal life, been really
enjoying what I've been working on lately: mostly lot's of studying for future skills/exams; plus 
had quite a bit going on IRL. I did manage to update this a bit: 

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Security_Demo_Web_App

Bit more functional but still  not quite what I wanted it to be, will certainly have to
brush up on my skills and make it a bit more interesting in the future. Much cleaner
overall though so happy with that for now.


https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/cmdinjscan.py

Happy with how it is shaping up but still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of reliable functionality.


https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/cmdinjscanner.cpp

Same with this too... definitely have some things to work on in private and eventually make public.

this will be very much ongoing as with Addison:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/Charli_0.7.2.cpp

Likely to be fewer and far between than previous updates due to new security specific work.

This I'm kind of exited about: 

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/Sila.cpp

Really nice banner scanner!

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/sila.go

and there is a go version of it!

Speaking of go this is the reason I got into it:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/SearchAbuse/blob/main/SES.go(save%20as%20main.go)

had written a python version of it (co-authored) that was pretty bad and relied upon some
just horrible packages to run.... but It got me thinking if there was a language better suited to 
the software I was trying to make. And turns out Golang is a great solution(hence why I ported sila to it).

Not that the packages where horrible as with the problems I had with the python version of SES but still 
Goolang seemed and has been a great choice: few more tools I may port to it but defiantly got to get
a bit more of security based focus, and may take away a bit from what I do on this GitHub but It will still be updated and maintained.

Who knows, may have some way cooler code/tools to show in the future.
