Random Security ramble writing.....[basically a text blog thing]
[09/01/2026]
"Hello Friend", yea that was kind of lame: but not as lame as all the mistakes in the only hacker show that(and I'm paraphrasing here): 
"make me not want to throw anything at the T.V by the end of the first series". Anyway: cheap ploy to get you're attention aside: 
What is computer security? Well, in it's most basic sense, it means making sure that devices/software are only accessed by authorized users.
So today I have not really done anything much as IRL I had a few things to do. I am so sorry for the mistakes I've made in the past I'm just trying my 
best to learn from them an do much better in the future, not being so lazy: abstaining from alcohol and the like. It's a hangover from the person I was: 
to the man I'm working to become: it will take some time but have a feeling it will be worth it.

So this week I have refactored some of the code base for a few things:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Security_Demo_Web_App

All but the cpp file(don't have the required library's for SQL on this box though that was my first choice for back-end)

Fixed and improved this in various ways:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.py

Made an untested powershell version: 

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.ps1

A lovely sea-plus-plus version:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/PortPeep.cpp

And updated this a bit:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/CMDUtilities/blob/main/SysNyAdminEnny.cpp

And updated this quite a bit:

https://github.com/ZeroDayGang-gh05t5h311/Scanners/blob/main/Sila.cpp


Plus studied a bit for serious upcoming projects... hopefully, much more to come.
